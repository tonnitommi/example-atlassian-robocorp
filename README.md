Prerequisite is to have following Vault items with exactly the same names (or edit code accordingly):

- Vault named Atlassian
- Key `jira_url` with the value being your jira url, like https://xyz.jira.net
- Key `jira_user` with the value being the jira user that creates tickets, usually an email adress
